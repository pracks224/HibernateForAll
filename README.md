   											Hibernate Tutorial
 Hibernate is an open source Java persistence framework project. 
 It performs powerful object-relational mapping and query databases using HQL and SQL. 
 Hibernate is a great tool for ORM mappings in Java. 
 It can cut down a lot of complexity and thus defects as well from your application, which may otherwise find a way to exist. 
 This is specially boon for developers with limited knowledge of SQL.

 Initially started as an ORM framework, Hibernate has spun off into many projects, such as Hibernate Search, Hibernate Validator, Hibernate OGM (for NoSQL databases), and so on.
